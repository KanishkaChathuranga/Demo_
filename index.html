                <center>
                    <p id="Main">The Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R)
                        is a car
                        built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a
                        sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It
                        succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although
                        this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline
                        line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline
                        and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi
                        plant in Japan.

                        As per Nissan's intention of creating a world beating sports car, the GT-R brand was revived as
                        part of the Nissan Revival Plan. Overall development began in 2000, following seven years of
                        development and testing, including the introduction of two concept models in 2001 and 2005. The
                        production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The GT-R is a
                        brand-new car built on the PM platform, and featured innovative concepts and technologies, such
                        as advanced aerodynamics, the VR38DETT engine, an active suspension system and the ATTESA E-TS
                        Pro all-wheel-drive system, making it the first ever rear mounted independent transaxle
                        all-wheel-drive vehicle. It is one of the first production cars to feature launch control and a
                        dual-clutch transmission as well. The overall body is made out of steel, aluminium and
                        carbon-fibre. In 2009 it set a record for the fastest accelerating 4-seater production car.

                        The GT-R is offered worldwide, unlike its predecessors which were sold in a limited number of
                        markets. It received various facelifts and updates to be up to date with the competition, and
                        several special editions were also offered during its prolonged production span. The car is used
                        in motorsports, notably winning championships in the FIA GT1 World Championship, Super GT and in
                        various GT3 racing series, including the GT World Challenge. It is well received among
                        enthusiasts and automotive publications as well, British motor magazine Top Gear named it as
                        "one of the most incredible cars of any kind ever built", due its exceptional performance and
                        practicality given at an affordable price. Being one of the fastest production cars, it has won
                        numerous notable accolades such as the World Performance Car of The Year among many others.

                        Sales in the Australian market were ceased due to new side impact regulations. In the European
                        market, including the United Kingdom were similarly suspended, due to newly implemented noise
                        regulations. Currently, the car is primarily available in North America, Japan, and some
                        markets.</p>

                used

                <p>In 2000, as per request of CEO Carlos Ghosn, Nissan embarked on the revival of their iconic sports
                    car model the GT-R, as part of the Nissan Revival Plan. Ghosn believed that introducing this halo
                    car would gather public interest and enthusiasm towards the then-struggling Nissan brand, ultimately
                    bolstering sales. Therefore, he claimed the GT-R should be made as a high-performance car, capable
                    of rivaling esteemed sports cars from manufacturers in the likes of Porsche, Lamborghini, and
                    Ferrari, all while maintaining a comparatively affordable price point. From a design standpoint,
                    Ghosn sought to preserve a distinctive feature from its predecessors; four round taillights, which
                    he considered the signature design element of all GT-R models. Development commenced in 2000, with
                    Nissan designers from Japan, United States and Europe generating a multitude of sketches. Out of
                    these, 50 designs reached the desk of Nissan's design director at the time, Shiro Nakamura. Nakamura
                    emphasized that the design must not only embody a modern sports car aesthetic but also encapsulate
                    Japanese cultural elements and pay homage to its predecessor's heritage. In 2001, Ghosn officially
                    announced ongoing development of the GT-R, with a concept reveal at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show. The
                    chief designer, Hiroshi Hasegawa, dedicated over four years to complete interior and exterior
                    styling designs. He claimed the design should exude sportiness, modernity, and aerodynamic
                    efficiency to meet the ambitious performance targets set for the car.[8][9]</p>

        <h2>Nissan GT-R (Artical)</h2>
        <p style="color: darkslategray; text-align: justify;">Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002,
            Nissan produced a high
            performance version of its Nissan Skyline coupe, the Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan,
            achieving much fame and success on the road and in motorsports.[3][4]

            The GT-R is an entirely new model, departing from its predecessor, the Skyline GT-R, which was a faster
            version
            of a regular sedan. Though they share a little with each other, such as the signature four round tail
            lights,
            the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system, and a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine, the GT-R diverges
            significantly. Notably, the GT-R omits the HICAS four-wheel-steering system, with engineers recognizing its
            incompatibility with the advanced all-wheel-drive setup, which would compromise the car's performance. The
            previous straight-6 RB26DETT engine is succeeded by the VR38DETT engine.[5] Another continuity from its
            predecessor is the chassis code; the all-new version is identified as CBA-R35 initially and later as DBA-R35
            and
            4BA-R35 for subsequent model years,[6] or simply R35 for short (where CBA, DBA, and 4BA denote the emissions
            standard prefix). The car also preserves the nickname of its predecessor, Godzilla, a moniker originally
            given
            by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in 1989 for its R32 generation model.[7]The Nissan GT-R (Gran
            Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan
            GT-R) is a
            car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports
            car
            and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds the Nissan
            Skyline
            GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear
            the
            GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from
            the FM
            platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at
            Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.

            set a record for the fastest accelerating 4-seater production car.

            The GT-R is offered worldwide, unlike its predecessors which were sold in a limited number of markets. It
            received various facelifts and updates to be up to date with the competition, and several special editions
            were
            also offered during its prolonged production span. The car is used in motorsports, notably winning
            championships
            in the FIA GT1 World Championship, Super GT and in various GT3 racing series, including the GT World
            Challenge.
            It is well received among enthusiasts and automotive publications as well, British motor magazine Top Gear
            named
            it as "one of the most incredible cars of any kind ever built", due its exceptional performance and

            given at an affordable price. Being one of the fastest production cars, it has won numerous notable
            accolades
