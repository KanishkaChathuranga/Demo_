    <h2>Engine deatails</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT engine, a 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu in) 60°
        degree DOHC V6 engine – which is shorter than other V6 engines and benefits weight distribution. The engine is
        based on the VQ engine, but thoroughly modified to improve performance and suit the car.[61] It featured the
        innovative hybrid wet/dry-sump pressurized lubrication system, controlled thermostatically to withstand high
        g-force and closed-deck construction increase stiffness. Cast iron cylinder liners are replaced by a 0.15 mm
        (0.0059 in) layer of plasma transferred wire arc sprayed cylinder bores, reducing friction for the piston rings
        to slide on when the piston moves up and down during the power cycle.[37] Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima (IHI)
        turbochargers provide forced induction, boosting more than 0.7 bar and its turbine housing is integrated into
        the exhaust manifolds to minimize lag, decrease weight and improve vehicle balance.[62] The engine was
        originally rated at a manufacturer-claimed engine output of 353 kW (473 hp) at 6,400 rpm and 583 N⋅m (430 lb⋅ft)
        of torque at 3,200–5,200 rpm, making it the most powerful engine fitted to a Japanese production vehicle at the
        time.[63] The engine is complied with California Air Resources Board Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV)
        standards.[61] It features 24 valves controlled by dual overhead camshafts (2 per cylinder head) with intake
        only variable valve timing. The engine with a block made out of cast aluminium, has a feedback control system
        which changes air fuel ratio depending on the engine load which reduces fuel consumption. Fully equipped with
        catalytic converters, turbochargers, engine accessories, front differential assembly and turbo outlet pipes, the
        engine weighs 276 kg (608 lb).[64] Notable features of the VR38DETT include,

        Continuously variable valve timing control system (CVTCS) on intake valve.
        Aluminium cylinder block with high-endurance/low-friction plasma-sprayed bores.
        Iridium-tipped spark plugs.
        Electronic drive-by-wire throttle.
        Multi port fuel injection.
        Pressurized lubrication system with thermostatically controlled cooling and magnesium oil sump.
        Fully symmetrical dual intake and low back-pressure exhaust system.
        Secondary air intake system to rapidly heat catalysts to peak cleaning efficiency.
        50 State LEV2/ULEV.</p>
